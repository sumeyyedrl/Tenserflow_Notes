# Tenserflow_Notes
I have completed an amazing course from [BTK Akademi](https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/) about Python and Tenserflow. This course and all the courses available in this site are free an it's such a great opportunity for Turkish students. I wanted to share my notes that I take during the course. 
You can reach my certificate via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumeyye-dural/).
